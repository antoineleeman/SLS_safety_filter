# Predictive safety filter using system level synthesis
This repository contains the MATLAB code that accompanies the research paper:
> Leeman AP., Köhler J., Bennani S., Zeilinger MN. “Predictive safety filter using system level synthesis.” Accepted L4DC2023 (2022)
The code in this repository demonstrates the implementation of the algorithms and models discussed in the paper. To run this code, you will need MATLAB and the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3 (MPT3).
## Prerequisites
- MATLAB (tested with version R20xx)
- Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3 (MPT3)
- MOSEK
## Installation
1. Download and install MATLAB from the official website.
2. Install the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3 (MPT3) by following the instructions from the official MPT3 documentation. In summary, you will need to:
a. Download the latest release of MPT3 from the MPT3 GitHub repository.
b. Extract the downloaded archive and add the extracted folder to your MATLAB path by running the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
